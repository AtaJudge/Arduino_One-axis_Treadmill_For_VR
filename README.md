# Arduino_Treadmill_for_VR
We measure the number of revolutions of the treadmill and give it to the computer as a joystick input for VR.
This Project is compatible with Atmega 32u4 (Arduino Micro, Arduino Leonardo etc.) boards. Our sensor is connected to D2 pin.

See the table at the bottom of the page in the link for the interrupt pins: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/
